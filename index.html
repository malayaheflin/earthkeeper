  <h2>Artists' Statement</h2>
  <p>“The Earthkeeper” is an interactive projection installation where users will be invited
    to use their movement to grow a desolate forest, which burns back down once fully alive.
    We hope to use our piece to demonstrate the meaning and beauty of cyclic regrowth. Through
    <b>hand-drawn animations, TouchDesigner, and an Ouster Lidar sensor</b>, we will allow users to manipulate
    the endangered environment projected before them. They will temporarily transition
    the dark and dreary forest into the vibrant place it once was, until the magic inevitably fades.
  </p>
  <p>Our piece will be publicly exhibited on May 9 2024 at the AV Williams Building, as part of the Immersive Media Design Capstone Fair. <br>
    Elaine, <a href="https://malayaheflin.github.io/" target="_blank" class="w3-hover-opacity">Malaya,</a> and Zoe are all graduating Immersive Media Design majors at the University of Maryland,
    College Park.
